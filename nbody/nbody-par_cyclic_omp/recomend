To whom it may concern.

I was involved in the same project with Pasha during internship at Fernuniversiteit Hagen Summer 2014. During that internship me and Pasha were working on project related to home automation. In this project me and Pasha were building softare Java-based solution to manage specific USB rely board(K8090 8-channels USB rely card). Me and Pasha were working on difference interfaces. When I was implementing basic TCP/IP + USB solution, Pasha was implementing TCP/IP + Bluetooth option. Our project was accepted by professor Mario Kubek (Chair of Communication Networks of the FernUniversit√§t in Hagen, Germany).

Besides great technical skills Pasha manifested himself as great teammate and leader of our small group. Pasha helped me personally to bootstrap with the project and build relationships with the team. I highly recommend Pasha to the future pursue his studies and researches in Computer Science.
